Our project was about a web app which connects to a maria Database hosted on the Amazon Web Service cloud (AWS). 
The database contained a Users Table with the following schema:
ID: (Autoincrement)
Name: varchar(20),
Password: varchar(20),
Email: varchar(20).

Even though we equally worked on the project, it helps to make it clear what role each of us took during the working on the project.

I took the initiative and started my part by building a project that meets the minimum requirement. 
for that startup project, I had built the ORM and persistence and the Web Servlet which uses the ORM to persist the data to the database. 
I used postman to test my ORM using Post, get, put, delete requests which implemented the CRUD operations. 
I showed a demo of the project and postman to my teammates during our working on the project and helped them in understanding the different parts of the project, especially the postman. 
I also included File Logging of exceptions and error handlings. 

in the meantime, Brian was trusted in building another ORM which used Reflection and Annotations to persists any object. 
His ORM also carried out CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and He tested his ORM and then I have integrated it to my Web Servlet because it uses Reflection. 
for that we had to work on the interface (methods) of his ORM jar file and got it to be used/invoked successfully from my servlets. 
He also helped implementing and connecting an html page to the ORM and database. Something I had set up as one goal of our project (bonus feature). 

Danial, helped in the overall discussion with his comments and valuable insight during the project time. He had to leave for his other job with the National Guard, 
but he was able to catch up with us and he successfully tested a project of his own to keep with the overall work of the project. 
He also was able to use postman to query database.  

though I don't like to explicitly state it, and even with my teammate acknowledgement and encouragement, for some time I was a head in the project 
and led the project into its final version.  However, I wouldnâ€™t have done it with my valuable team who amazed me by their great work and skills.

Also, we had reached Kyle for one problem in pushing to repository and he helped us in that and in following the right steps in importing a jar file. 

below is the given requirement of project 1. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Project 1
Description
Your next project will build upon the concepts from project 0, adding the following topics:

HTTP
ORM
Servlets
DevOps (bonus: automate it fully)
Project 1:
You will be building an API which exposes functionality to accept, deserialize, and persist objects in a database. Your API will be remotely accessible and accessed by Postman. A front-end GUI is not required for MVP. You will expose an API which will accept incoming GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests. We will use Postman to test and consume your API. Your API will depend on a custom ORM which will be written in it's own project, packaged as a .JAR file, and used as a dependency.

Part 1 - Custom ORM:
You will develop a custom ORM which uses reflection to dynamically build CRUD functionality without being aware of the structure/schema beforehand. This should abstract all JDBC and persistence logic away from the other part of the project. Your ORM is a dependency to be utilized by the other part of the project.

Part 2 - Web Service:
You will create your own web service used to store, manipulate, and retrieve objects in response to HTTP requests. Your service will be remotely available on AWS, and will utilize your ORM as a dependency. You will expose an API using Java servlets that allow us to manipulate the objects as resources. You will decide on what sort of resources your service can handle. Make up some sort of service, use your imagination, and design the resources that you would store. Example: An airline microservice that persists data about customers. It doesn't need to worry about aircraft or billing, it's just persisting and recalling user POJOs to suport some other application.

You will be expected to complete the minimum viable product by the deadline and give a brief presentation demonstrating your project and answering questions from the QC team.

This project will be done in teams of 2-3 members that will be assigned when we begin.

Minimum Requirements
Proper use of OOP principles
CRUD operations are supported for at least 2 types of objects.
Communication is done with HTTP exchanges, and resources are transmitted as JSON in request/response bodies.
JDBC and persistence logic should all be part of your ORM which abstracts this away from the rest of the application.
Documentation (all classes and methods have adequate Javadoc comments)
All Exceptions are caught and logged to a file
Bonus Features
Basic HTML/CSS/JS front end to consume API
ORM can build foreign key relations according to object references.
ORM can design schema on the fly.
Automated DevOps CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy project
Adequate unit test line coverage for service-layer methods(Test as much as possible, ask trainer if unsure)
Object Store
These are user stories to describe the web service. This is a remotely accessible storage service for persisting and retrieving objects/resources over the internet.

Minimum Viable Product
As a user, I store JSON objects by invoking the proper endpoint (POST/Create).
As a user, I can change objects by invoking the proper endpoint (PUT/Update).
As a user, I can retrieve objects by invoking the proper endpoint (GET/Read).
As a user, I can delete objects by invoking the proper endpoint (DELETE/Delete).
As a user, I can retrieve all objects that belong to me. (transmit the user as part of the request header, and build a relation in the db in some way to tie the objects to the user)
Tech Stack
You should be employing the following technologies in your project.

Java 8
HTTP
Servlets
Apache Maven for dependencies and project management
Git & Github for version control
MariaDB deployed on AWS RDS for data persistence
Custom ORM for data persistence
Deadline & Presentation
Finalized version of your project must be pushed to your team's p1 repository within the training originzation by 9:00 AM Central time on the date of the presentation showcase. Commits after that time will not be considered. The most recent commit submitted before that time will be the version of the project that is graded.
Presentation Showcase (Due Date): Thursday, Feburary 10th 2022, 9:00 AM CDT.
You will give a brief (10 minute) presentation of your project. Be prepared to answer questions about your work from the QC team.
Your work MUST BELONG TO YOUR TEAM. Collaboration is allowed and encouraged, but at the end of the project each team member must have an excellent understanding of every line of code in your project and be able to answer questions about any part of it.
